# Light-Following-Arm

This project is from the final Lab Assignment in my ECE 5 class, Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering. In this project, I use the knowledge gained throughout the quarter to build a light-following arm using photoresistors and PID controls to make the servo arm follows a lit-up LED in a row of LED’s. This project tests my understandings of **sensors, actuators, C programing, systems and controls.**

This project consists of 5 challenges and you can find the code files for each challenge in separate folders. For challenge 1, go to challenge_1 folder for the code; for challenge 2, go to challenge_2 folder for the code, and so on.

For challenge 5, a user interface using MATLAB is required. You can find the files for this in Light Following Arm folder. To use it, just launch the MATLAB app named “controller” in MATLAB.

If you would like to look at the questions for the Lab Assignment to get an overview of each challenge, then navigate to the ECE 5 Final Lab file.
